# Color Game Project
A responsive web application game built to test a user's ability to guess a color based on RGB value.

## How To Play
* Adjust difficulty by selecting **easy** (4 cards), **medium** (9 cards) or **hard** (16 cards)
* Click the card whose color matches the *RGB Value* in the header.
* If your guess is incorrect, the card vanishes.
* If your guess is correct, you earn points.
* You earn a point for each card remaining on the screen.
* Play up to ten rounds to get the highest score you can.
* Reset the game by selecting **start over** or changing difficulty.
* Try to get a high score of 30 on easy, 60 on medium and 90 on hard mode!

## RGB Color Model
This is an *additive color model* named after the initials of the three primary colors: **Red**, **Green** and **Blue**. Red, Green and Blue right are added together to produce a color. The intensity of each primary color is indicated by a number, from 0 (no color) to 255 (highest intensity).

For example, a value of (255, 0, 0) would create vivid red, while (0, 255, 0) would create vivid green and (0, 0, 255) would create vivid blue. Here are several additional illustrative examples:
* Black - (0, 0, 0)
* White - (255, 255, 255)
* Yellow - (255, 255, 0)
* Cyan - (0, 255, 255)
* Magenta - (255, 0, 255)
